Initially had to clean all the disaster created by rodents, chain and it's sprocket was jammed by a old cloth, wheels were jammed.

- Free the chains and wheels
- Dis-assembled the body-kit, seat, fuel tank.
- Tried to start the bike, kick started after 40-50 kicks and it ran for 2-3 seconds and never started again.
- Check and adjusted the points and cleaned the spark plug, the bike didn't start, 
- I didn't work on the bike for almost 2 years, 
- I set up a mini working space and started analyzing the key units
- Ordered point set and wiring harness, it took more than 2 weeks to get the packages.
- Added new point set and tried to start, i was able to see better spark after the update
- Didn't know what the issue was at that point of time.
- So I tried to boost start it by spraying the fuel directly to the carburettor.
- 🔥🔥 the bike started in couple of kicks.
- I started working on the carburettor, cleaned it and installed it.
- 🎉 The bike started.
- Now is the big challenge, to take the rust off from the parts and paint the bike.

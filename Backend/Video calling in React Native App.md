**Signaling** - Signaling in the context of video calling and webRTC, refers to the process where communication peers exchange network information required to setup and maintaion a peer-to-peer connection.
In simple terms, signaling is like saying hello, agreeing on how to talk, and finding each other so you can start your special video call. It's what makes sure everything works smoothly when you want to talk to someone far away using video!

Implementing video calling without using third-party libraries in React Native is highly challenging due to the complexity of real-time media streaming and signaling required for peer-to-peer connections. However, I can outline a basic approach using WebRTC, which is a standard technology for real-time communication over the web and mobile platforms.

### Using WebRTC Directly

WebRTC is a powerful but complex technology that handles real-time communication, including video calling, directly in the browser or mobile applications. Here’s a high-level overview of how you might approach implementing it in a React Native app without third-party libraries:

#### 1. Set Up WebRTC

WebRTC requires signaling to establish peer-to-peer connections. You typically need a signaling server (backend) to facilitate this process. You can use libraries like `socket.io` for signaling.

#### 2. Install Dependencies

You'll need to install several dependencies to handle WebRTC in React Native:

```bash
npm install react-native-webrtc
npm install socket.io-client
```

#### 3. Implementing Video Calling

Here's a simplified example of how you might implement video calling:

##### Setting Up Peer Connections

First, set up your signaling server. For example, using `socket.io`:

```javascript
const io = require('socket.io')(server);

io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  // Handle signaling messages between peers
  socket.on('offer', (data) => {
    socket.broadcast.emit('offer', data);
  });

  socket.on('answer', (data) => {
    socket.broadcast.emit('answer', data);
  });

  socket.on('icecandidate', (data) => {
    socket.broadcast.emit('icecandidate', data);
  });
});
```

##### React Native Client Code

In your React Native app, you'll use `react-native-webrtc` for handling media streams and `socket.io-client` for signaling:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';
import { View, Button } from 'react-native';
import { RTCPeerConnection, RTCView, mediaDevices } from 'react-native-webrtc';
import io from 'socket.io-client';

const signalingServer = 'http://your-signaling-server-url';

const App = () => {
  const [localStream, setLocalStream] = useState();
  const [remoteStream, setRemoteStream] = useState();
  const [socket, setSocket] = useState();

  useEffect(() => {
    const init = async () => {
      const stream = await mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
        audio: true,
        video: true,
      });
      setLocalStream(stream);

      const socket = io(signalingServer);
      setSocket(socket);

      socket.on('offer', async (data) => {
        const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection();

        peerConnection.onicecandidate = (event) => {
          if (event.candidate) {
            socket.emit('icecandidate', event.candidate);
          }
        };

        peerConnection.ontrack = (event) => {
          setRemoteStream(event.streams[0]);
        };

        await peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(data);
        const answer = await peerConnection.createAnswer();
        await peerConnection.setLocalDescription(answer);

        socket.emit('answer', answer);
      });

      socket.on('answer', async (data) => {
        await peerConnection.setRemoteDescription(data);
      });

      socket.on('icecandidate', async (data) => {
        await peerConnection.addIceCandidate(data);
      });
    };

    init();

    return () => {
      if (socket) {
        socket.disconnect();
      }
    };
  }, []);

  const startCall = async () => {
    const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection();

    localStream.getTracks().forEach(track => {
      peerConnection.addTrack(track, localStream);
    });

    const offer = await peerConnection.createOffer();
    await peerConnection.setLocalDescription(offer);

    socket.emit('offer', offer);
  };

  const endCall = () => {
    // Implement logic to end the call and clean up resources
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <RTCView streamURL={localStream?.toURL()} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />
      <RTCView streamURL={remoteStream?.toURL()} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />

      <Button title="Start Call" onPress={startCall} />
      <Button title="End Call" onPress={endCall} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```

#### Considerations

- **Complexity**: WebRTC is complex, and this example is highly simplified. Real-world applications require handling more edge cases, error handling, and security considerations.
- **Signaling**: You need a signaling server for WebRTC connections. This example uses `socket.io` for simplicity, but in production, you would need a more robust signaling mechanism.
- **Media Permissions**: Ensure your app requests appropriate permissions (camera, microphone) from users.

### Conclusion

While this example provides a basic framework for implementing video calling using WebRTC in React Native without third-party libraries, it’s important to recognize that handling real-time communication involves significant complexity. Using a well-established third-party library like Twilio or Agora simplifies many of these challenges and provides additional features (like transcoding, recording, and cross-platform support) out of the box. For most production applications, leveraging such libraries is recommended unless you have specific reasons not to.

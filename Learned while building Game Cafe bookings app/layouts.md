```js
<div className="h-screen flex flex-col">
<div className="flex-1">
//{body/header/main component}
</div>
//{footer component}
</div>
```
- The above example learnt while building a responsive page layout to always place the footer at the end of the screen, without overlapping with the other components when the screen size reduces.
